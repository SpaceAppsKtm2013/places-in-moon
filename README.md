==============

Places in Moon is a Web application that will allow users to take an interactive tour of the Moon. Users will be able to view different lunar locations such as craters or landing sites. Also they can search different places on the moon and view pictures of respective places based on latitudes and longitudes. We will use java, javascript, xml and MySQL to make the web application and use the datasets provided by Grail MoonKAM (https://moonkam.ucsd.edu/image_gallery/data).
